This small project is helpful for downloading Coursera courses into your Google Drive via Google Colab. You can use it with given instruction below or given [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kaanaritr/Coursera-GDrive/blob/master/extras/EasyDownloader.ipynb) file easily.
This module makes it easier to mount your google drive and download all enrolled courses from Coursera. 

All enrolled courses can be downloaded by the methods given below,(For more detailed explanations, see the section ''Usage''.)
* Calling download() function,
* Making a list that includes the course names,
* Reading from a text file that contains the course names,

## Getting Started
An overview of CGDD via Google Colab,how to download and use,some basic tips ,explanations and more.

### Prerequisites
- Coursera-dl Package ( version>=0.11.0 )
- You have to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
- If you have never experienced it , then I strongly recommend you to use this powerful and free platform.


### Installing

You can download it by using the command below in your terminal.

```
pip install Coursera-GDrive
```


## Usage

### How to use this package without writing code?

If you don't want to waste your time to read this documentation, then just download [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kaanaritr/Coursera-GDrive/blob/master/extras/EasyDownloader.ipynb) file, follow the instructions in the given file and run it on your Google Colab.

### If you want to use this package by writing your own code;

First of all, you have to know the basics of Python to understand the given instructions below.

### Initializing

- #### Initialize the downloader object with default save folder (COURSERA).
	```
	from coursera_gdrive import CourseraDownloader
	
	downloader = CourseraDownloader() 
	```
- #### Initialize the downloader object with save folder <folder-name> in your Google Drive.
  - If downloader can't find given folder, it will automatically creates itself.

  ```
  from coursera_gdrive import CourseraDownloader
  
  downloader = CourseraDownloader(<folder-name>)

  # Example:
  # downloader = CourseraDownloader("coursera_files")
  ```

### Authentication and Authorization

Before we go further, we must authenticate ourselves first. For that purpose, we need to CAUTH token which is using for one of the main authentication method by Coursera.

- #### How to find your Coursera CAUTH token by using your browser?

	If you are looking for an easy solution, you can install this [Browser Extension](https://github.com/e-learning-archive/browser-extension) to find your CAUTH token easily.

	1. First login to `coursera.org` in your web browser :  
	1. For example, in chrome, Go to settings
	1. Advanced
	1. Privacy and Security
	1. Site Settings
	1. Cookies and Site Data
	1. See all cookies and site data
	1. coursera.org -> **CAUTH**
	1. Copy the content and Paste to **\<cauth-token>**
	

	```
	cauth = <cauth-token>

	# Example:
	# cauth = "t-w_itR2tML6ZWA_myKtQeC0JO97SJFkh3PgatWw32t4nrlZrHKsfe2sw"
	```
- #### How to login with your CAUTH Token?

	```
	downloader.login(cauth)
	```
### Courses Lists
Last one step before download, if you want to see some useful courses list, you have to read this section.

- #### How to see all enrolled Courses?

	```
	downloader.printEnrolledCourses() 
	# Prints all enrolled Courses.
	```
- #### How to see all available courses in Coursera?

	```
	downloader.printAllCourses() 
	# Prints all courses in Coursera.
	```

### Downloading the Courses

- ### How to set subtitle languages before you start the download?
	There is a new method to do that "setSubtitles". Default subtitle languages is "all". If you don't use this method, downloader will download all the available subtitle languages.

	- #### Set 1 subtitle language.

	```
	downloader.setSubtitles("<language-tag>") 

	# Example:
	downloader.setSubtitles("fr") 

	# If subtitles is available in French, downloader will download it.
	# If the entered language is not available, then it will try to download alternative subtitle language (Default alternative language is English).
	```
	
	- #### How to know the language tag of my language?
		There is a method to help you. "showLanguages"
	```
	downloader.showLanguages()

	# Gives the list of 2 character language codes of some widely used languages.
	# There may be other codes that is used in Coursera.
	# To learn more, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
	```

	- #### Set multiple subtitle languages.

	```
	downloader.setSubtitles("<language-tag1>","<language-tag2">,...)

	# Example:
	downloader.setSubtitles("fr","de","tr") 

	# If subtitles is available in French, German and Turkish, downloader will download them all.
	# If any or all entered language is not available, then it will try to download alternative subtitle language (Default alternative language is English).
	```

	- #### Set alternative language and change default common alternative language.


	```
	downloader.setSubtitles("<language-tag>|<alt-lang-tag>") 

	# Example:
	downloader.setSubtitles("fr|de")
	downloader.setSubtitles("fr|de","tr|it","az") # Multiple Subtitles
	
	# If subtitles is available in French, downloader will download it. Else it will try to download subtitles in German. Furthermore, if the alternative language is not also available, it will try to download English subtitles.
	```
	- #### If you don't want to state alternative languages for each subtitle one by one, you can use the commonAlternative keyword argument (Default : English). 
	```
	downloader.set(downloader.setSubtitles("<language-tag>", commonAlternative = "<language-tag>") 
	downloader.setSubtitles("<language-tag1>","<language-tag2">,..., commonAlternative = "<language-tag>")
	
	# Example:
	downloader.setSubtitles("fr", commonAlternative = "de") 
	downloader.setSubtitles("fr","de","tr|en" , commonAlternative = "it")
	```

- ### How to download all of my enrolled course?
	It's very straight forward. Just call the download method.
	```
	downloader.download()
	# Downloads all enrolled courses.
	```
- ### How to download just one course?
	Make sure that the class name you are using corresponds to the resource name used in the URL for that class:
	 `https://www.coursera.org/learn/<course-name>/home/welcome`
	 
	**Example:**
	`https://www.coursera.org/learn/`**algorithmic-toolbox**`/home/welcome`

	```
	downloader.download("<course-name>") 
	# Downloads just <course-name>.

	# Example:
	# downloader.download("algorithmic-toolbox")
	```
- ### How to download one or more course?
	There are several methods to download multiple courses easily.
	- #### Multiple Course String Argument
	```
	downloader.download("<course1>","<course2>","<course3>",...) 
	# Downloads all the given courses.

	# Example:
	# downloader.download("algorithmic-toolbox","crypto","iot","python-ar")
	```
	- #### Python List Argument
	```
	course_list = ["<course1>","<course2>","<course3>",...]
	downloader.download(course_list) 
	# Downloads all courses in python list.

	# Example:
	# course_list = ["algorithmic-toolbox","crypto","iot","python-ar"]
	# downloader.download(course_list)
	```
	- #### Passing a text file as an argument
	Make sure that,
	1. Course names in text file are separated by a newline.
	2. Text file is in the save folder. ( Default: COURSERA )
	```
	downloader.download("<courselist.txt>") 
	# Downloads all courses in text file.

	# Example:
	# downloader.download("course_list.txt")
	```

	- #### Passing mixed arguments
	```
	course_list = ["<course-x>","<course-y>","<course-z>",...]
	downloader.download("<course1>","<course2>","<course3>","<courselist.txt>",course_list) 
	# Downloads all the given courses, courses in text file and courses in python list.
	```
